    <title>March Meeting is CANCELLED!!</title>
    <pagecontent>&lt;div&gt;Since our first meeting over three years ago, we've had an unbroken streak of monthly meetings unrivaled by any of our peers in the Houston .NET Community.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Through births, deaths, job changes, last minute speaker cancellations, oh-no-I-forgot-to-order-pizza escapades, and even in the face of HURRICANE IKE, we have never lapsed in our mission to bring you free pizza, swag, and great speakers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Until this month, when we've been hit by a cosmic triple whammy: Spring break for most area schools, St. Patrick's Day, and Lone Star College is completely shut down for Spring Break&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We tried our best, but we can tell when the Universe is telling us to take a month off.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you can't go a month without pizza and a .NET talk, please visit our brethren at HDNUG for their meeting THIS THURSDAY, March 10.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We look forward to seeing you next month on April 21, when the Universe will once again be nice to us.&lt;/div&gt;</pagecontent>

    <title>A Tale of Three Transitions</title>
    <pagecontent>&lt;span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: consolas, monospace; font-size: small; color: #000000; line-height: normal; "&gt;Agile transformation doesn't look the same in all circumstances. Plus, it's not the planned hurdles that tend to be the most challenging or require the most skill to overcome. Each organization is different and has unique roadblocks standing between software teams and agile adoption. In this presentation we'll study the path, hurdles, and successes faced by three distinct organizations and how they overcame, or compromised during their journey.&lt;/span&gt;</pagecontent>

    <title>Building Microsoft Applications Today and Tomorrow</title>
    <pagecontent>It is a time of uncertainty for software developers. While in the past, a developer’s choices were down to which language and IDE to choose to develop on Windows or the Web, options have now exploded. The proliferation of various devices and their move into mainstream use has created change at a pace orders of magnitude faster than before. Do you develop a Windows app? A Web app? A mobile device app? Slates? You are faced with a plethora or options, platforms, IDEs, and development languages. How do you choose which to use? And most importantly, how do you protect your current investment both in terms of the applications you use as well as your personal knowledge you have built app?
&lt;br&gt;
Our BUILD Conference Update is postponed until November.

    <title>The CODE Framework</title>
    <pagecontent>The CODE Framework is a free, .NET-based development framework. It consists of various components and tools that help developers with common aspects of business application development, such as simplified SOA development with various clients, or WPF development, data access, and much more. The main focus of this framework is to enable productive, flexible, and highly maintainable business application development. We'll be demonstrating how to use the CODE Framework to quickly develop the user interface for a SOA application. Along the way we'll discuss why you would want to use SOA architecture for your applications.

    <title>Introducing Microsoft StreamInsight: Getting Kinky with Real-Time Data</title>
    <pagecontent>Introduced as a part of the Sql Server 2008 R2 platform, StreamInsight is Microsoft's Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine. It allows you to analyze and process large volumes of data - think tens to hundreds of thousands of events per second - with sub-second response time. It's as close to real time as you can get without quantum entanglement! The Sql Server engine may be fast ... but it's just not that fast. This presentation will introduce core CEP concepts and sample uses cases and then dive into kinkiness with real-time data, including hosting StreamInsight, getting data into (and out of) the engine, how time is handled, writing queries in Linq and how to extend the StreamInsight engine. It's a whole new paradigm of looking at data.</pagecontent>

    <title>Entity Framework 0-60 (maybe 120 if we don't get pulled over)</title>
    <pagecontent>This meeting we will dive into the approaches to Entity Framework out there. Where they make sense, where they don’t, and how to get better at leveraging it. We will cover code first mapping, testing, and querying as well as talking about the architecture around your data access layer. This will lead us down a path with many questions and I encourage you to ask them. We will strive to debate and answer all the questions posed. So bring an open mind and a list of your questions.</pagecontent>

    <pagecontent>Correspondence is SkyDrive for your objects. When you build an app using the Correspondence framework, it stores your objects locally and in the cloud. The same app running on another device pulls down those objects. When you change data on one device, the UI on the other is refreshed. It works online, it works offline, and you don't need to care. The API to make all this possible is clean and simple.</pagecontent>

    <title>SignlR</title>
    <pagecontent>Messaging over HTTP has become an integral aspect of our collective user experience as we interact with applications that affect our daily lives.  From Facebook to Google docs to online help desk applications, real-time messaging is no longer a neat trick, but an expected component of browser, mobile, and desktop applications for today’s users.&lt;br&gt;
This session will cover SignalR, a sophisticated, open-source web-messaging framework designed to make real-time messaging across multiple clients painless.  We will cover the various techniques that have been employed over the years to achieve real-time communication over HTTP along with the challenges of each in order to showcase the elegance of SignalR by comparison.&lt;br&gt;
From there, Michael Nero will showcase some SignalR features in practice, as well as show some advanced usages of SignalR through an engaging SignalR demonstration designed to push the limitations of browser-based clients.&lt;br&gt;

    <title>Message Passing in C# will change your life</title>
    <pagecontent>&lt;p&gt;
Heard of Erlang? Me neither. In this presentation, we will discover what message passing means for .NET developers, through interactive demos with the audience. Think Gallagher comedy shows.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whether you're wiring up an almighty SOA with messages, programming with Actors, or if you just want to understand the C# event keyword, this talk is for you.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Curious? In this talk we'll discuss:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why object-oriented programming is a lie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How objects are people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acing your next interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why your SOAP web services are terrible and why you should be ashamed of yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application of message passing via a three act play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    <title>Iteration 0: Setting up Onion Architecture for distributed systems using NServiceBus and Continuous Integration</title>
    <pagecontent>Onion Architecture is an architectural pattern for keeping libraries and dependencies on the extremities of a software system while building a strong and cohesive system core.  Distributed systems like those that leverage NServiceBus and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) products have characteristics that challenge layering principles of non-distributed systems.  This session will show how to properly structure and layer a .Net/C# software system that makes use of Onion Architecture, NServiceBus, and ASP.NET MVC.  The target audience for this session is:  C#, architect, senior engineer, team leads/lead developers.</pagecontent>

    <title>Hyper-V for Developers</title>
    <pagecontent>You’ve probably heard all the hub-bub about virtualization and Hyper-V but all it’s all been focused on infrastructure and networking types. But developers can – and should - leverage virtualization technologies as well. In this session, we’ll start with a quick overview of virtualization and what Hyper-V is and then we’ll get into some details on how to set up virtual machines, networks and disks. We’ll also look tips and tricks to use this technology more effectively, such as virtual machine checkpoints/snapshots, sysprep and sharing wireless connections with Hyper-V VMs. You’ll walk away with a better understanding of sometimes mysterious configuration and settings options and armed with the know-how to begin building your own virtual machine empire!</pagecontent>

    <title>Test driving Azure Search and DocumentDB</title>
    <pagecontent>I cover the basics of setting up Microsoft Azure Search and DocumentDB in your Azure environment. Then we will see how to generate and load data into both. From there I will walk you through an example car listings web site that demonstrates a search first (Azure Search) navigation experience backed by a NOSQL (DocumentDB) data store. By the end of this talk you will walk away with a fair understanding of how to set up and configure Azure Search and DocumentDB for your applications. You will learn how to use faceted searches to deliver the best search results for your users. And you will learn how to include a NOSQL implementation into your application as well as when to choose it over a relational database.</pagecontent>

    <title>Breaking Up is Hard To Do:  From Monolith to Microservices</title>
    <pagecontent>In this talk I will discuss the trend from Monolithic applications to Microservices, the benefits and pitfalls of the move, and give anecdotal and practical advice on how to tease those services out of an existing web application.  We’ll talk a bit about the impact to development, QA, and deployment that this change will have.  And I’ll walk through separating out a new microservice using common .NET technologies.</pagecontent>

    <title>Domain Modeling with F#</title>
    <pagecontent>F# makes it easy to encode domain models within its type system such that it is quite possible to never allow invalid states while retaining a simple, readable code base. We'll look at a few examples, including how best to deal with inheritance vs composition, units of measure, and even language extensions for extensible domain specific languages.
