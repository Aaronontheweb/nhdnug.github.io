I once wrote a short story that never got published. I went on to draw some comics that did get published. 
For a summer, I worked as a carnie. Then, in the Army, I learned how to effectively sweep hallways and change 
the tire on a Humvee (HMMWV). Finally, I wrote some code that people used and I liked it and they liked it. 
Then, I studied computer science. Now, I help teams of programmers by joining them on the journey of writing 
really big, maintainable applications.
