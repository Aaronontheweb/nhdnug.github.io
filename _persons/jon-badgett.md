Jon earned an MBA in 2015 from Sam Houston State University, and a BBA in 
Management Information Systems from the University of Arkansas in 2006. He currently 
leads a software development team at an international chemical company.

If it's technical, .Net or web related, or tastes good - Jon's probably interested. An 
"optimistic pragmatist", Jon's goal is to love what he does and have those who work 
alongside him do the same.
