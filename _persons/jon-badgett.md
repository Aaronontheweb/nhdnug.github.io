Jon is a passionate developer who enjoys refining the developer experience. He currently leads a software development department at an international chemical company.

If it's technical, .NET or web related (especially TypeScript + React), or tastes good - Jon's probably interested. An "optimistic pragmatist", Jon's goal is to love what he does and have those who work alongside him do the same.
