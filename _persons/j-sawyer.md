J is a Senior Architect for Hitachi Consulting based in Houston, TX who loves to write code and build cool, innovative solutions to hard problems. When not coding, J likes to hang out with his family, play with his computers and ride his Kawasaki Concours 14. But he doesn't code and ride at the same time. That would be bad.
