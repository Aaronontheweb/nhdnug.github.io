Daniel is a Senior Consultant with Improving, currently working in an agile Team with C# and React. But in his first year of working in software, right out of college, he met his nemesis: Bad Meetings! These treacherous icons of business promise efficient decision making, and progress, but seldom deliver. Being an engineering type, this evident duplicity bugged Daniel. And after a few iterations, heâ€™s cobbled together a few tools to help curb the blight that is bad meeting design! Long live the Productive Engineer!
