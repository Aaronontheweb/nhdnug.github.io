John Cavnar-Johnson is a software developer/architect working as a Principal Consultant for Improving. 
In the last 25 years, he’s been a corporate developer, IT sysadmin, software development manager, 
IT enterprise architect, consultant, and entrepreneur, but mostly he’s spent his time solving 
problems and hooking stuff together. Before becoming a professional software geek, John was lucky 
enough to meet Grace Hopper, take a graduate school course from Barbara Jordan, and marry Mary 
Cavnar-Johnson, MD.
 
When he’s not toying with tiny WiFi devices or designing enterprise software, you can 
find him reading, enjoying craft beer, and hanging out in his hot tub (often at the same time).
