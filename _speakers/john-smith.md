John currently works for Avanade as a Software Engineering Manager. 
He loves building things, digital or physical. The challenge of 
creating something new is very exciting. Maybe it already exists, 
maybe it doesnâ€™t; but the journey is always fun. In his free time 
he plays Australian Rules Football.

This is the first time I went snowshoeing. It was last year in Rocky 
Mountain National Park in Colorado. If you have never been, you 
should try it once. You can be some spectacular views that are unrivaled.
