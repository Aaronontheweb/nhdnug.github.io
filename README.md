Welcome to the repository home for North Houston .Net User Group's website.

We allow contribution to our site... In fact, we encourage it!!!

If you'd like to make a change, please, make a pull request.

There's a couple things you should probably read though - especially if you're developing on Windows:
* [Run Jekyll on Windows](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) - This will get you up and running with the GitHub Pages framework. Very Helpful.
* [Jeckyll Docs](http://jekyllrb.com/) All the info you need to get productive in jekyll
* [GitHub Flavored Markdown Cheatsheat](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) - As nice as MD is, GFM is even nicer. This'll give you the syntax cheats.

If you at least skim the cheat sheet - and follow along with what's going on in the rest of the source - you should be good to go. If you have any big changes you want to make, just make a pull request. Chances are, it'll be fine!
