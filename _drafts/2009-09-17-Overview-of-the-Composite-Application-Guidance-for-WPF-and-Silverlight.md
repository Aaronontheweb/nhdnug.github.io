title : Overview of the Composite Application Guidance for WPF and Silverlight
description : This presentation covers an overview of the Composite Application Guidance for WPF (codename Prism), its architecture and Composite Application Library (CAL), and how applications are be built on top of it. If you build any application that goes beyond "Hello World", it's likely that you create composite applications. Prism allows for applications to be built with proper separation of concerns, promoting loose coupling, extensibility, and testability. It also helps with WPF's goals of allowing developers and designers to collaborate more easily on the same project. The presentation also cover some dependency injection and Model-View-ViewModel patterns.
