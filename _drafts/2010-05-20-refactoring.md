Command design pattern, Lambda Expressions, Extension Methods, fluent interfaces, refactoring,
test-driven development, writing elegant code, and more. This session will cover a little bit of many things
learned from projects I've been working on. We expect every attendee to learn a few tricks that can be applied
immediately, and also to feel encouraged to go out and research more on whatever area appeals the most.
