title : Getting Started with the ADO.NET Entity Framework
description : While most enterprise applications are object-oriented, the data upon which they depend is not. Often, binding these two platforms together can result in significant amounts of lost productivity and a less than optimal solution.
Come see how you can resolve this recurring theme by leveraging the ADO.NET Entity Framework as your Data Access Layer.
In this session, we’ll…
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    Explore the Entity Framework and its related components&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
    Design an Entity Data Model using the designer tools
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Walk through a variety of examples of how to interact with the model
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Demonstrate advanced mapping scenarios
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Compare Entity Framework to LINQ-to-SQL
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
You’ll walk-away with a clear understanding of how the Entity Framework can greatly simplify your DAL and enable you to program against a conceptual model of your data, versus the actual data store itself.
