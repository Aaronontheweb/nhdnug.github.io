If you tend to always use List&lt;Whatever&gt; for your collections and nothing else,
then this talk may be for you. We will cover design and performance considerations
when using collections and review the classes that support collections in .NET.
While LINQ is not the primary focus of this discussion, we will cover the design patterns of LINQ that
you can use in your code.
