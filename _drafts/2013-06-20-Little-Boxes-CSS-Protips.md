What is CSS to you? Maybe an annoying roommate, complete stranger or your best friend forever. In this talk we'll explore CSS, how to implement it, deal with it in the wild and handle compatibility. Whatever your skill level, hopefully you'll walk away feeling a little better about dealing with little boxes.
