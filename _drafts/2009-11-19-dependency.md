In this talk Harry will discuss the Dependency Inversion Principle, an extremely important element of
any application with any degree of complexity, where high cohesion and loose coupling of components is vital.
He will define the principle and explain how it is implemented. He will then present two illustrative examples.
The first will show how it may be implemented when using Microsoft's new Prism framework. The second will show how
to go about implementing it in a legacy application.
