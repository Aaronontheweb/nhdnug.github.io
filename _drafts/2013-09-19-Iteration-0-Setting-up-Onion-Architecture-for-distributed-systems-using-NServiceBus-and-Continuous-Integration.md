Onion Architecture is an architectural pattern for keeping libraries and dependencies on the extremities of a software system while building a strong and cohesive system core.  Distributed systems like those that leverage NServiceBus and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) products have characteristics that challenge layering principles of non-distributed systems.  This session will show how to properly structure and layer a .Net/C# software system that makes use of Onion Architecture, NServiceBus, and ASP.NET MVC.  The target audience for this session is:  C#, architect, senior engineer, team leads/lead developers.
