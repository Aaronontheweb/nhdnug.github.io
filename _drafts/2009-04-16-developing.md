With each new version of Silverlight, Microsoft has continued to improve the features and toolset
available for building rich internet applications (RIA).
Silverlight 3 has solved many of the issues facing RIA developers in Silverlight 2; including navigation,

We will walk through developing a data centric application in Silverlight 3 and discuss the role of Silverlight
in future application development.
