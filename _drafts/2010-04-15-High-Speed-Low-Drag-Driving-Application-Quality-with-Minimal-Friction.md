title : High Speed, Low Drag: Driving Application Quality with Minimal Friction
description : &lt;span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d;"&gt;Software teams
are continually under pressure to do more in less time, to build higher
quality and ever more complex applications on ever increasing ship
cadences.&amp;nbsp; In this session we will use Microsoft’s Visual Studio 2010
Application Lifecycle tools to demonstrate how to deliver bugs that get
fixed first time, every time; how to prevent regression with Coded UI
Tests and Automation for Navigation; how to streamline build and
application deployment using Lab Management and virtual environments;
and how to identify the source and impact of changes even when
developers “forget” to mention them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
