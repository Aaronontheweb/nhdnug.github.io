While most enterprise applications are object-oriented, the data upon which they depend is not.
Often, binding these two platforms together can result in significant amounts of lost productivity
and a less than optimal solution. Come see how you can resolve this recurring theme by leveraging the
ADO.NET Entity Framework as your Data Access Layer.

In this session, we'llâ€¦

* Explore the Entity Framework and its related components
* Design an Entity Data Model using the designer tools
* Walk through a variety of examples of how to interact with the model
* Demonstrate advanced mapping scenarios
* Compare Entity Framework to LINQ-to-SQL

You'll walk-away with a clear understanding of how the Entity Framework can greatly simplify your
DAL and enable you to program against a conceptual model of your data, versus the actual data store itself.
