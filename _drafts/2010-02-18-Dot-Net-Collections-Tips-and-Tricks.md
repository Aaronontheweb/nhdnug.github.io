&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d;"&gt;If you tend
to always use List&amp;lt;Whatever&amp;gt; for your
collections and nothing else, then this talk may be for you.&amp;nbsp; We will
cover design and performance considerations when using collections and
review
the classes that support collections in .NET.&amp;nbsp; While LINQ is not the
primary focus of this discussion, we will cover the design patterns of
LINQ that
you can use in your code.&lt;/span&gt;
