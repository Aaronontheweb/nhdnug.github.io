&lt;span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #444444;"&gt;In the time
that LINQ to SQL has been available, we have been identifying ways to
make LINQ to SQL better. We have compiled all of those cool tips and
tricks including new features into a set of CodeSmith templates. PLINQO
opens the LINQ TO SQL black box giving you the ability to control your
source code while adding many new features and enhancements. It's still
LINQ to SQL, but better!&lt;/span&gt;
