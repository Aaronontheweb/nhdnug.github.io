---ï»¿date : 2013-03-21title : Correspondencedescription : Correspondence is SkyDrive for your objects. When you build an app using the Correspondence framework, it stores your objects locally and in the cloud. The same app running on another device pulls down those objects. When you change data on one device, the UI on the other is refreshed. It works online, it works offline, and you don't need to care. The API to make all this possible is clean and simple.location : Lone Star College - Montgomeryspeaker : Michael Perrybio : Michael is a Principal Consultant with Improving Enterprises in Dallas.speakerurl : email : twitter : sponsor : Improving Enterpriseslogo : improvinglogo.png---
