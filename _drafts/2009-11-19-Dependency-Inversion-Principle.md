title : Dependency Inversion Principle
description : &lt;span style="color: #1f497d;"&gt; In this talk Harry will discuss
the Dependency Inversion Principle, an extremely important element of
any application with any degree of complexity, where high cohesion and
loose coupling of components is vital.&amp;nbsp; He will define the principle
and explain how it is implemented.&amp;nbsp; He will then present two
illustrative examples.&amp;nbsp; The first will show how it may be implemented
when using Microsoftâ€™s new Prism framework.&amp;nbsp; The second will show how
to go about implementing it in a legacy application.&lt;/span&gt;
