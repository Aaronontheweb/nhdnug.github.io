Over the last few years, .NET developers have been introduced to many new technologies from Microsoft- Silverlight, ASP.NET AJAX, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, LINQ, LinqToSQL, WPF, XAML, Azure, RIA Services, Prism and on the list goes. While we all as developers enjoy seeing technology improve, sometimes it can be hard to see the big picture and understand how best to use everything that's new- or know enough to avoid using technologies that aren't quite ready for prime-time.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In this session, Telerik Chief Evangelist and Microsoft MVP Todd Anglin will be you guide to understanding how all of these technologies fit in the big picture. This unconventional session format will be 1 part demo, 3 parts Q &amp;amp; A, so bring your burning .NET questions and prepare to finally make sense of the complete .NET developer technology scene!&lt;/div&gt;
