Introduced as a part of the Sql Server 2008 R2 platform,
StreamInsight is Microsoft's Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine.
It allows you to analyze and process large volumes of data - think tens
to hundreds of thousands of events per second - with sub-second
response time. It's as close to real time as you can get without quantum
entanglement! The Sql Server engine may be fast ... but it's just
not that fast. This presentation will introduce core CEP concepts and
sample uses cases and then dive into kinkiness with real-time data,
including hosting StreamInsight, getting data into (and out of) the
engine, how time is handled, writing queries in Linq and how to extend
the StreamInsight engine. It's a whole new paradigm of looking at data.
