Onion Architecture is an architectural pattern for keeping libraries and dependencies
on the extremities of a software system while building a strong and cohesive system core.
Distributed systems like those that leverage NServiceBus and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
products have characteristics that challenge layering principles of non-distributed systems.
This session will show how to properly structure and layer a .Net/C# software system
that makes use of Onion Architecture, NServiceBus, and ASP.NET MVC.  The target audience
for this session is:  **C#, architect, senior engineer, team leads/lead developers.**
