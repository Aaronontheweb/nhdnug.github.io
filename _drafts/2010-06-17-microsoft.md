We start with an introduction to new operating system technologies for many-core scale computing and proceed with
illustrative examples of parallel work-item partitioning, scheduling, and collation.
Featured technologies and tools include Windows 7 (x64), Visual Studio 2010, the Microsoft .NET
Framework 4 Parallel Extensions, the C++ Concurrency Runtime, the Parallel Debugger,
and the Concurrency Analyzer.
