Heard of Erlang? Me neither. In this presentation, we will discover what message passing means for
.NET developers, through interactive demos with the audience. Think Gallagher comedy shows.

Whether you're wiring up an almighty SOA with messages, programming with Actors,
or if you just want to understand the C# event keyword, this talk is for you.

Curious? In this talk we'll discuss:

* Why object-oriented programming is a lie
* How objects are people
* Acing your next interview
* Why your SOAP web services are terrible and why you should be ashamed of yourself
* Application of message passing via a three act play
