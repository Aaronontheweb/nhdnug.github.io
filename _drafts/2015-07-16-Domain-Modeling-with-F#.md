title : Domain Modeling with F#
description : F# makes it easy to encode domain models within its type system such that it is quite possible to never allow invalid states while retaining a simple, readable code base. We'll look at a few examples, including how best to deal with inheritance vs composition, units of measure, and even language extensions for extensible domain specific languages.
