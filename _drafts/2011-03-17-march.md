Since our first meeting over three years ago, we've had an unbroken streak of monthly meetings
unrivaled by any of our peers in the Houston .NET Community.
Through births, deaths, job changes, last minute speaker cancellations, oh-no-I-forgot-to-order-pizza escapades,
and even in the face of HURRICANE IKE, we have never lapsed in our mission to bring you free pizza, swag, and great
speakers.

Until this month, when we've been hit by a cosmic triple whammy: Spring break for most area schools,
St. Patrick's Day, and Lone Star College is completely shut down for Spring Break

We tried our best, but we can tell when the Universe is telling us to take a month off.

If you can't go a month without pizza and a .NET talk, please visit our brethren at HDNUG for their meeting
THIS THURSDAY, March 10.

We look forward to seeing you next month on April 21, when the Universe will once again be nice to us.
