Visual Studio released in the summer of 2015, and with it came C# 6. Joe will be 
reviewing some of the new language features. In addition, you will get to see how 
those features work, not just in the latest version of .Net (4.6), but in prior 
versions. Finally, Joe will try to help you determine which features you should 
focus on adopting immediately, and which ones you can gradually adopt, as the need arises.

The session will loosely follow a series of blog posts currently being written at 
[Joeâ€™s website](http://www.infocraft.net/tag/new-features/).

Slides, soure code, and more information are available on 
[Joe's GitHub site](http://jmreynolds.github.io/CSharp-6-New-Language-Features/).
