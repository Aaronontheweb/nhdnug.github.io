Computing power of systems is increasing through the use of multiple cores instead of by the increase in processor speed.  To take advantage of these proliferating cores, one must learn what has historically been error prone multi-threaded programming.  To assist the programmer in easily developing multithreaded applications that fully utilize all this power, .Net 4.0 and 4.5 have added extensions to the language and additional libraries that greatly facilitate the programmer in harnessing these capabilities.  This session will overview the use of the Task Parallel Library, Dataflow, Reactive Extensions and Async/Await constructs in .Net that will allow you to become a parallel programming guru.
