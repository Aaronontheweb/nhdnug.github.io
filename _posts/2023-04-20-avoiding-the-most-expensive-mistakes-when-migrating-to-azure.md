There are many tools and virtual widgets among the more than 600+ Azure services. However, the road to moving your workloads from On Premise A to Cloud B is guaranteed to have a few speed bumps or hairpin, cliff-hugging turns as the case may be.

We’re happy to share our “Lessons Learned” along this path from cost projections to shared storage latency. Join us for a candid look at moving a multi-million dollar service from hardware hell to a virtual cloud-based utopia.
