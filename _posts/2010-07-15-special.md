This month we're ditching our normal presentation format.&nbsp;
Instead, we'll offer a set of mini-presentations (10-20 minutes each) from a number of different speakers.
Topics will include an introduction to F# and an overview of DDD (Domain Driven Design).

### Historical Note

This was our first Lightning Talk! Unfortunately, we don't have records for who presented or what the topics were. If
 you were one of the presenters, please [let us know](mailto:info@nhdnug.org?subject=2010 Lightning Talk)!
