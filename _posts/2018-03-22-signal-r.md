Wouldn't it be nice if we could have full RPC-type functionality in our web apps, allowing us to call javascript code that's running on a page without require a round trip to the server? Or to feed frequently updated data to clients without polling? How about pushing status of long-running operations down to the client? Oh... yeah... and we'd like to do all of this across multiple browsers and clients in a way that scales and works through firewalls.

Sound impossible? It's not. Sound difficult? With SignalR, it's not. In this presentation, we'll take a run around SignalR and how this can be incorporated into a wide variety of applications, from web apps to services to Windows client apps, all using a single API that make real-time push notifications simple and straightforward.

**Note** This month we're meeting on the **4th Thursday of the month (the 22nd)** instead of the 3rd due to the college being closed for spring break.
