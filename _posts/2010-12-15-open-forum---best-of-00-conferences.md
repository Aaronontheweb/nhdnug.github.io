Did you attend any conferences or training in 2010?  What did you learn about that was particularly interesting or noteworthy?

Come join us as we discuss some of the best new stuff we saw in 2010.  We'll have some topics ready to discuss, but we also want to hear from you.

As part of our end-of-year blowout, we'll have some extra special prizes to raffle off.

Please note that we will be meeting in A-110 (not our normal room) in December.
