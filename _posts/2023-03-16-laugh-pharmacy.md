Are you ready to take your jokes to the next level? Join us as we dive into the world of real-time joke delivery using SignalR, Blazor, and MAUI. We'll show you how to enhance the user experience by streaming jokes in real time while using [Reactive Extensions](https://github.com/dotnet/reactive) to model the asynchronous nature of SignalR.

You'll gain a deeper understanding of how to use SignalR with Blazor and MAUI to make your applications more interactive. So, come along for the ride, and let's bring some humor to our app!
