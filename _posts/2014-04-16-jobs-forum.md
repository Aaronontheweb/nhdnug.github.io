Looking for a job?  Looking for good people?  Then this is the meeting for you.  We'll discuss the state of the job market in Houston, as well as how to interview .NET candidates.  We'll have a number of guest panelists including Paladin Consulting, Mike Yeager of EPS, Jeffrey Palermo of Clear Measure, and Allen Hurst of Improving Enterprises.  As always, spirited discussion from our members is highly encouraged.
