While most enterprise applications are object-oriented, the data upon which they depend is not. Often, binding these two platforms together can result in significant amounts of lost productivity and a less than optimal solution.
Come see how you can resolve this recurring theme by leveraging the ADO.NET Entity Framework as your Data Access Layer.
In this session, we’ll…
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
    Explore the Entity Framework and its related components</li>
    <li>
    Design an Entity Data Model using the designer tools
    </li>
    <li>Walk through a variety of examples of how to interact with the model
    </li>
    <li>Demonstrate advanced mapping scenarios
    </li>
    <li>Compare Entity Framework to LINQ-to-SQL
    </li>
</ul>
You’ll walk-away with a clear understanding of how the Entity Framework can greatly simplify your DAL and enable you to program against a conceptual model of your data, versus the actual data store itself.
