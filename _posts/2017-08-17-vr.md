We're living in the future--VR is here! Peter will give a 10 minute lightning talk about how working in 3D inside of VR is revolutionary, and how your C# knowledge is particularly useful in VR contexts.
 
Then (as the talk can only explain the experience, not experience it for you) we'll open the floor up and have the entire group try VR out themselves while we hang out and discuss Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality trends. Depending on what you're interested in, you can draw in 3D, build 3D models...or just shoot a bow and arrow at cartoon enemies, if that's really what you want in life. This should be fun!
