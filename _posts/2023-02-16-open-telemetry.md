[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is the future of observability and application performance monitoring (APM) in .NET and all other major runtimes (NodeJS, Go, Java, etc.) OpenTelemetry is even embedded directly into the base class libraries of .NET through the System.Diagnostics.Activity namespace.

So how can we take advantage of this in our applications in order to provide useful dashboards for monitoring them and detailed traces for discovering how our software behaved dynamically at run-time?
In this talk we explore OpenTelemetryâ€™s concepts, explain how the OTel implementation works in .NET, and demonstrate how to use the syntax and NuGet packages quickly and easily inside your own applications.
