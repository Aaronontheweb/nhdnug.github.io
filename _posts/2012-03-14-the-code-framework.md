The CODE Framework is a free, .NET-based development framework. It consists of various components and tools that help developers with common aspects of business application development, such as simplified SOA development with various clients, or WPF development, data access, and much more. The main focus of this framework is to enable productive, flexible, and highly maintainable business application development. We'll be demonstrating how to use the CODE Framework to quickly develop the user interface for a SOA application. Along the way we'll discuss why you would want to use SOA architecture for your applications.
