Curtis Schlak will be presenting on Polymer & X-Tag Web Components. 

[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) "unlocks the power of Web Components. Polymer is a JavaScript library that helps you create reusable HTML elements, and use them to build performant, maintainable apps."

[X-Tag Web Components](https://x-tag.github.io) is a "Microsoft supported, open source, JavaScript library that wraps the W3C standard Web Components family of APIs to provide a compact, feature-rich interface for rapid component development. While X-Tag offers feature hooks for all Web Component APIs (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, Templates, and HTML Imports), it only requires Custom Element support to operate. In the absence of native Custom Element support, X-Tag uses a set of polyfills shared with Google's Polymer framework." The framework is supported by Edge, Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Mac & iOS Safari, as well as Opera.
