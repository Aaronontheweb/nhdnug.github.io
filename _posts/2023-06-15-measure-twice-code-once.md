Highly performant code is important, all the more so in our modern cloud-centric pay-per-cpu costing model. But given the ever-evolving nature of our industry, if the new coolness also efficient or just cool? I’ve been developing software as a consultant for over 20 years, focused on large distributed systems, and that has led me to some very clear opinions about where and how to measure performance, what trade-offs are worth it, and which are not. In this session you’ll learn what tools I use to evaluate performance, the areas of an application to focus on for performance, and how each of these interact with cloud-based hosting strategies of today.
