As part of the work I’ve been doing for many years, I get to do a lot of code review. I usually 
document things that come up doing a code review so I can share it with other developers in the teams. 
In this session, I share some of the code I’ve looked at, the reasons why the code raised yellow or red 
flags in my head, and possible solutions I’ve proposed.
