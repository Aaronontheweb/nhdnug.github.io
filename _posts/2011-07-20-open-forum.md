This month we'll have an open discussion forum.  Have a particular gnarly design problem that you'd like some feedback on?  Interested in hearing some opinions about what changes Windows 8 might bring with it?  Have some insight on a new technology that you'd like to share?  We'll throw everything out on the table for discussion.
