Visual Studio LightSwitch is a Rapid Application Development framework that leverages a coordinated set of existing Microsoft technologies (SilverLight, Entity Framework, WCF and SQL Server) to facilitate the creation of data-driven line-of-business applications.&nbsp; LightSwitch has several extensibility points, and one of the most important (from a design perspective) is the ability to extend a LightSwitch application with SilverLight controls.
