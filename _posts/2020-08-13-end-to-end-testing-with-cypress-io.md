Ahmed will introduce End to End Testing, why you'd want to use it and some pros and cons. He'll then go over Cypress.IO, covering installation and use. He will also walk through some specific examples of using Cypress.IO on a sample application and talk about some best practices. If time permits, Ahmed may delve into some of Cypress.IO's own examples and cover some key points and gotchas.
