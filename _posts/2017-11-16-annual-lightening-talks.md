It's that time again for our Annual Lightning Talks! This year's talks are:

### Ditching the Loop - Brian Dudley
LINQ expressions, sets in SQL, vectorization in Python, Apply in R all represent a switch away from imperative programming. Working in these new ways can be difficult, but the thought processes are similar. This talk discusses how to write code that avoids explicit loops and expresses more of the What than the How.

### ALM in VSTS - Martin Mason
Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) is Microsoft’s cloud based solution for Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). In this talk, VSTS will be used to trace a change to an SQL Server Azure DB from requirements and design using User Stories and Tasks to Deployment using Build and Release templates with full traceability throughout.

### DotNet Core with Angular - Christine Piffat
Angular, TypeScript, WebPack, RxJS – what are these and where can I start as a .NET developer? Most of the articles on these technologies assume they will be used as a stand-alone application. This talk will use the new template to set up a .NET Core application with Angular and go over what is included so that you can begin learning the new client-side tools in a familiar environment.

### C# 7: New Language Features - Joe Reynolds
C# is an ever changing language. Come learn about all the new features in version 7!
