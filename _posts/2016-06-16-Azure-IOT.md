John Cavnar-Johnson will be speaking about his experiences working with the Azure Internet of Things. 
In this session, you'll learn how to get started with real-world, end-to-end IoT solutions that cost 
five bucks and how to think about IoT security to avoid becoming part of the Incredibly Dangerous 
Internet of Things (#IDIoT).  

**This is a working session, so bring your laptop and a MicroUSB to USB cable to get hands-on experience!**
