**Our room has changed. We are now in G-109.**

Deploying custom in-house developed applications to Azure could mean installing them onto a set of VMs with, for example, IIS and SQL Server installed on them, in the same way as you might on-premises... However, particularly for developers, there is a *Better Way*! Come to this session to learn about how much of the automated infrastructure available to developers in Azure can be used to simplify your deployments and enable both rapid change and your ability to easily scale your applications with *NO VM's at all*. 

This presentation will be primarily a demo. We will walk through a sample cloud-native .NET application automatically deployed from VSTS to Web and API apps, Functions, and Logic apps using a SQL Database backend (to name just a few). Bring all your solution Architecture, security and development questions!
