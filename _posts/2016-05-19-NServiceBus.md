 Reliability, durability, and availability are all things we worry about when
we build large scale applications. A very common approach to addressing these
is using a message based, distributed architecture. This talk will give a
sampling of using NServiceBus as your messaging infrastructure. This will be a
code heavy talk, so expect on the fly coding, random attempts at humor and compiler errors.
