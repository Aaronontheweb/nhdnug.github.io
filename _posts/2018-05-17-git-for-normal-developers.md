Are you a developer who recently started using Git in VSTS? Maybe you’ve been using it for a while, but your team needs some help with branching and merging? Or maybe you just want to see some of the tools out there that make Git easier to use?

This is the class for you! We’re going to focus on what most of us do 75% of the time in Git, and how to use that to make your life easier.
