The Houston .NET Users Group and NHDNUG are joining forces this month for a remote session, featuring an out of state speaker we wouldn't normally have the pleasure of hosting. Webex information is at the bottom of the post.

There's a lot of confusion about async/await, Task/TPL, and asynchronous and parallel programming in general. So let's start with the basics and look at how we can consume asynchronous methods using Task and then see how the "await" operator can make things easier for us. Along the way, weâ€™ll look at continuations, cancellation, and exception handling.
