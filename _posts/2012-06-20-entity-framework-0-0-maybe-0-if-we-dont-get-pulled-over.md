This meeting we will dive into the approaches to Entity Framework out there. Where they make sense, where they don’t, and how to get better at leveraging it. We will cover code first mapping, testing, and querying as well as talking about the architecture around your data access layer. This will lead us down a path with many questions and I encourage you to ask them. We will strive to debate and answer all the questions posed. So bring an open mind and a list of your questions.
