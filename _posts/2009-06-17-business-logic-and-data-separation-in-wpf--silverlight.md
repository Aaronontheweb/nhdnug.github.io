Starting with a short history on familiar patterns like MVC and MVP, we’ll quickly move on to a discussion of Model-View-ViewModel (M-V-VM). This chalk talk will cover the use of WPF / Silverlight features like data binding, validation and commands to isolate business logic from UI design. We’ll wrap up with a short demonstration of these patterns applied.
