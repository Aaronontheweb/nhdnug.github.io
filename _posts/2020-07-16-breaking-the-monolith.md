The Houston .NET Users Group and NHDNUG are joining forces again this month for a remote session. Webex information is at the bottom of the post.

Microservices are the future of modern application development, but nearly all of the successful software originate from the classic monolith. The ones who embark on this journey to break a monolith have aspirations such as decoupled deploys, scalability, resilience, development velocity, and more. They want to grow their number of teams while delivering value in parallel, faster and independently of each other. Thus, adopting to the microservices pattern is a prerequisite to agile and DevOps transformation. The speakers had an opportunity to travel on similar journey and this talk is summary of their learnings for decomposing monolithic applications to Cloud Native applications.
