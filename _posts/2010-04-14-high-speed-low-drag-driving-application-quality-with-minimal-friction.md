Software teams are continually under pressure to do more in less time, to build higher quality and ever more complex applications on ever increasing ship cadences. In this session we will use Microsoft’s Visual Studio 2010 Application Lifecycle tools to demonstrate how to deliver bugs that get
fixed first time, every time; how to prevent regression with Coded UI
Tests and Automation for Navigation; how to streamline build and
application deployment using Lab Management and virtual environments;
and how to identify the source and impact of changes even when
developers “forget” to mention them.
