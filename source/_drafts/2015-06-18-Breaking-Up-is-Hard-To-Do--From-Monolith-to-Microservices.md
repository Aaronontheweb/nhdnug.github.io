In this talk I will discuss the trend from Monolithic applications to Microservices, the benefits and pitfalls of the move, and give anecdotal and practical advice on how to tease those services out of an existing web application.  We’ll talk a bit about the impact to development, QA, and deployment that this change will have.  And I’ll walk through separating out a new microservice using common .NET technologies.
